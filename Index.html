        Kansas basketball is one of the most storied programs in college basketball history, deeply rooted in tradition
        and
        excellence. The University of Kansas Jayhawks began their basketball journey in 1898, making them one of the
        oldest
        collegiate programs in the country. Fittingly, their first coach was Dr. James Naismith, the inventor of
        basketball
        himself. Over the decades, the Jayhawks have evolved into a powerhouse, consistently ranked among the nation's
        elite
        teams and becoming synonymous with success on the hardwood.

        Playing in historic Allen Fieldhouse, often referred to as “The Phog,” Kansas has one of the most electrifying
        home-court atmospheres in all of sports. The venue, named after legendary coach Forrest “Phog” Allen, is a
        cathedral
        for basketball fans and regularly hosts sell-out crowds of over 16,000 fans. The crowd's fervor is unmatched,
        particularly during the singing of the pregame anthem "Rock Chalk, Jayhawk," a chant that resonates across
        college
        basketball as one of the most iconic traditions.

        <h4>National Success</h4>Kansas has won multiple NCAA championships, with titles in 1952, 1988 2008, and 2022,
        along
        with numerous Final Four appearances that underline their consistent success. The program has produced some of
        the
        greatest players and coaches in the history of the game, including Wilt Chamberlain, Danny Manning, and Jo Jo
        White,
        as well as coaching legends like Larry Brown, Roy Williams, and Bill Self. Under Self, who has led the team
        since
        2003, the Jayhawks have maintained their dominance, regularly securing Big 12 Conference titles and establishing
        record-setting winning streaks.

        <br><br>The program attracts top-tier talent from across the country, consistently sending players to the NBA
        and
        other professional leagues. Recent stars like Joel Embiid, Andrew Wiggins, and Devonte’ Graham highlight Kansas'
        ability to mold players into elite-level competitors. This emphasis on excellence and development ensures that
        the
        Jayhawks remain a perennial force in the ever-competitive landscape of college basketball.

        <h3>Long-time Rivalvries</h3>Kansas basketball is also defined by its rivalries, particularly the intense
        competition with the Missouri Tigers and Kansas State Wildcats. Though the Border War with Missouri was put on
        hiatus when Missouri left the Big 12 in 2012, its legacy remains a defining part of the program's history. The
        Sunflower Showdown with Kansas State continues to provide thrilling matchups that energize fans across the
        state.
